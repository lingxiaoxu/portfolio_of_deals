NELSON-SIEGEL METHODOLOGY:
==================================================
Mathematical Model:
y(τ) = β₀ + β₁((1-e^(-τ/λ))/(τ/λ)) + β₂((1-e^(-τ/λ))/(τ/λ) - e^(-τ/λ))

Parameter Interpretation:
β₀ = Long-term yield level (30Y Treasury level)
β₁ = Short-term vs long-term spread (slope factor)
β₂ = Medium-term curvature (2Y-5Y-10Y hump)
λ = Decay parameter (controls curve shape)

Forward Rate Formula:
f(t₁,t₂) = [(1 + z(t₂))^t₂ / (1 + z(t₁))^t₁]^(1/(t₂-t₁)) - 1
